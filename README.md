# Bloc Jams
### Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

## The Process

This app was built using a combination of guided instruction, exercises, and assignments. While the implementation of many features was left to my design, the project as a whole was meant as a large tutorial.

Subsequent projects in the [Bloc](http://bloc.io) program are far more open-ended, with much less guidance supplied at the onset.

An example of a much more independent project: [Blocitoff](https://github.com/npauzenga/Blocitoff)
